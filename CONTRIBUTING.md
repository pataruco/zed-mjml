# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to MJML for Zed!

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install [Zed](https://zed.dev)
3. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (for building the LSP)
4. Install the extension locally:
   - Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Run "zed: install dev extension"
   - Select the cloned directory
5. Open a `.mjml` file to test your changes

## How It Works

The extension has two main parts:

1. **Language definition** (`languages/mjml/`) — Uses [tree-sitter-html](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html) to parse MJML files since MJML is syntactically identical to HTML. The `.scm` query files provide MJML-specific syntax highlighting, indentation, and outline support.

2. **Language server** (`crates/mjml-lsp/`) — A Rust binary that validates MJML documents using two passes:
   - **Tag scanner pass** — Scans source text for MJML tags and validates semantic rules (nesting, required attributes, unknown tags, singletons)
   - **mrml parser pass** — Uses [mrml](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml) to catch structural XML errors (unclosed tags, malformed markup)

## Making Changes

### Syntax Highlighting

Edit `languages/mjml/highlights.scm`. Capture names map to theme colours:

- `@keyword` — structural tags (`mjml`, `mj-head`, `mj-body`)
- `@type` — head configuration tags (`mj-attributes`, `mj-style`, etc.)
- `@tag` — all other tags
- `@attribute` — attribute names
- `@string` — attribute values and quotes
- `@comment` — HTML comments

### Adding New MJML Tags

If MJML adds new components:

1. Add the tag to `KNOWN_TAGS` in `crates/mjml-lsp/src/rules.rs`
2. Add nesting rules in `allowed_parents()`
3. Add required attributes in `required_attributes()` (if any)
4. Update the `#match?` patterns in `languages/mjml/highlights.scm` to categorise them appropriately

### Language Injection

Edit `languages/mjml/injections.scm` to add or modify embedded language support (CSS in `<mj-style>`, JavaScript in `<script>`, etc.).

### LSP / Diagnostics

The validation logic is split across three modules in `crates/mjml-lsp/src/`:

- **`rules.rs`** — MJML specification data (known tags, allowed parents, required attributes, typo suggestions via Levenshtein distance)
- **`scanner.rs`** — Byte-level tag scanner that extracts `TagInfo` structs with attributes and parent-child relationships
- **`validate.rs`** — Walks scanned tags and produces `LintDiagnostic` results for 4 rules: nesting, required attributes, unknown tags, and singleton enforcement

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Run the LSP test suite:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path crates/mjml-lsp/Cargo.toml
```

### Manual Testing in Zed

The `test/` folder contains sample MJML files for manual verification:

- `test/valid/` — Files that should show no diagnostics
- `test/invalid/` — Files that should trigger specific errors and warnings

After making changes to the LSP:

1. Rebuild: `cargo build --manifest-path crates/mjml-lsp/Cargo.toml`
2. Restart Zed (`Cmd+Q`) to pick up the new binary
3. Open files from `test/valid/` and `test/invalid/` to verify

For language definition changes (`.scm` files), reload the extension:

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run "zed: reload extensions"

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a branch for your changes
2. Run `cargo test --manifest-path crates/mjml-lsp/Cargo.toml` and ensure all tests pass
3. Test manually with files in the `test/` folder
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why

## Releasing

Releases are managed with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) plus a manual binary build. The version in `Cargo.toml`, `extension.toml`, and `crates/mjml-lsp/Cargo.toml` is kept in sync automatically, and it must match the version published to the Zed registry.

1. **Land changes on `main` using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)** (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.). These determine the next version number.

2. **Merge the release-please PR.** release-please opens and continuously updates a "release" pull request that bumps the version across `Cargo.toml`, `extension.toml`, and `crates/mjml-lsp/Cargo.toml`, and updates `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging it creates the `zed-mjml-v<version>` tag and a matching GitHub release.

3. **Build and upload the language server binaries.** From the Actions tab, run the **Deploy** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`) and pass the new tag (e.g. `zed-mjml-v0.1.0`). It cross-compiles `mjml-lsp` and uploads one `mjml-lsp-<target>.gz` asset per platform to the release:
   - `aarch64-apple-darwin`
   - `x86_64-apple-darwin`
   - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

   This step is required: `src/lib.rs` downloads these assets from the latest GitHub release at install time, so the release must carry them before anyone installs the new version.

4. **Update the Zed extension registry.** Open a pull request against [`zed-industries/extensions`](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions):
   - Update the `extensions/mjml` submodule to the released commit.
   - Set the `version` for `[mjml]` in `extensions.toml` to match `extension.toml`.
   - Run `pnpm sort-extensions` to keep `extensions.toml` and `.gitmodules` sorted.

   Once the PR is merged, Zed packages and publishes the new version.

> If you later want to automate step 4, the community [`huacnlee/zed-extension-action`](https://github.com/huacnlee/zed-extension-action) can open the registry PR for you on tag push.
